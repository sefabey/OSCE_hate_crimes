This is a quick repo for creating a area cartogram (a.k.a. a value-by-area map or an isodemographic map). The goal is to create a global distorted map based on the frequency of recorded and/or reported hate related incidents in the year 2016.

The data are collected, aggregated and maintained by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) available on the OSCE website (http://hatecrime.osce.org/taxonomy/term/228). We have created a dataset by manually scraping the incidents from the OSCE's website which were reported from 34 States.
